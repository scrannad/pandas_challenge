# PyCitySchools

This project uses pandas to analyze school district data including budget, school type and size, per student spending, and standardized test scores in reading and math. The analysis identifies trends in school performance to inform strategic planning and budget priorities.

## District Summary
Includes the following:

- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## School Summary
Includes the following:

- Highest-performing schools by % overall passing
- Lowest-performing schools by % overall passing
- Math scores by grade
- Reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type

## Analysis
As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).

As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
